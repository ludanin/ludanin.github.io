# Notes on this repository

Everything you'd like to inpect is in the `src` folder. `docs` holds the
compiled production build, and is only uploaded to this repository in order
to host my portfolion using the GitHub Pages.

### Why there are some 'ยง' scattered around my comments?

These are sections.

While coding for personal projects, I often use an extension in my code
editor that allows me to jump between sections (ยง), providing me a nice
overview of where these sections are in my codebase.

Hierarchically speaking, they are very similar to markdown headers `#, ##, ###, ...`
the only exception that they range from `ยง0` to `ยง4`.

I don't use this extension on professional projects, since in these cases
the best way to maintain a good codebase is consistency and not personal
preferences--i.e. stick with the well established standards.
