# Notes on this repository

Everything you'd like to inpect is in the `src` folder. `docs` holds the
compiled production build, and is only uploaded to this repository in order
to host my portfolion using the GitHub Pages.

Since sometimes I work on multiple environments (Windows & Linux) you'll
probably note that I name all the files in this repository as lower_snake_case.extension

I do this in order to avoid possible conflicts between the two OSes, as Windows
cannot differ between lower & upper cases in file names.

### Why there are some 'ยง' scattered around my comments?

These are sections.

While coding for personal projects, I often use an extension in my code
editor that allows me to jump between sections (ยง), providing me a nice
overview of where these sections, and their subsections, are in my codebase.

Hierarchically speaking, they are very similar to markdown headers `#, ##, ###, ...`
the only exception is that they range from `ยง0` to `ยง4`.

I don't use this extension on professional projects, since in these cases
the best way to maintain a good codebase is consistency and not personal
preferences--that is to say, I should stick with the well established standards
and practices.
